# Noughts and Crosses Terminal Game

## How To Play

Noughts and Crosses is an in terminal version of a classic pen-and-paper game Tic-Tac-Toe, more commonly known in the UK as Noughts and Crosses.

The aim of the game is match 3 of your own pieces in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

In this version, a user will enter the amount of players (1 or 2), determining whether they will be playing with a friend or the randomly generated computer. 

The player 'X' will then be asked to input an X coordinate and then a Y coordinate of where they wish to place their piece. 

The player will then switch to 'O' and will be asked for an X and Y coordinate. This pattern alternates until either a player has matched 3 of their pieces or all the spaces have been filled resulting in a tie.
